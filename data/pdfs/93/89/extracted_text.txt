EMPLOYER'S RESPONSE 15 USC § 1673, 8 AAC 95.030

6. The employee is entitled to a weekly exemption of either $473 (under Alaska law2) or
75% of the employee’s weekly net earnings (under federal law), whichever is more.3 To
determine the amount which can be garnished, compute the following:
a. Weekly net earnings: $ minus $ 473.00 = $
b. Weekly net earnings: $ times .25 = $
c. The smaller of the above two amounts is: $
d. Other garnishments. List any other garnishments of the employee’s earnings
currently in effect:

Subtract “d” from “c:” $
If your pay period is not weekly, adjust the amount garnished accordingly.
Pay period is weekly biweekly twice a month monthly
Amount to be sent to the court each pay period:
7. Does employee's weekly salary vary depending on hours worked or commissions?
Yes If yes, you must recalculate the amount that can be garnished each pay
period.
No
8. Are employee's earnings currently being garnished up to the legal limit by a former lien?
Yes No
Previous lien(s) is/are expected to terminate on .
(date)
If employee's earnings are subject to a lien from a previous Writ of Execution for
Garnishment of Earnings, you must continue paying on that writ until it has been
satisfied or otherwise terminated, at which time this writ will be in full force and effect
until the TOTAL AMOUNT DUE stated on the writ is paid in full. If the previous writ
does not take the entire amount available for garnishment, you must begin paying the
2 AS 09.38.030 states that the weekly amount is $350. However, AS 09.38.115 requires the
Department of Labor to change that amount based on changes in the consumer price index.
So, the actual amount of the exemption (currently $473) is set in Department of Labor
regulation 8 AAC 95.030. Note: AS 09.38.050 allows the court to increase the exemption
amount under the circumstances described in that statute.
3 The employee is also entitled to a federal weekly exemption of 30 times the federal minimum
wage if that amount exceeds the 75% exemption. 15 USC 1673. The current hourly minimum
wage is $7.25. 29 USC 206(a)(1). That calculation is not included on this form because the
Alaska weekly exemption is larger than the federal “30 times minimum wage” exemption.

court the amount calculated in #6e for the enclosed writ and recalculate that amount
when the prior writ or withholding order terminates.
9. If the answer to #8 was No, then commencing immediately, the service of this Writ of
Execution for Garnishment of Earnings upon you creates a continuing lien against the
debtor's earnings.

in #6e each payday until a) the TOTAL AMOUNT DUE shown on the Writ of Execution
for Garnishment of Earnings has been paid; b) the employment relationship has been
terminated; or c) you have been instructed by the court that the judgment has been
vacated, modified or satisfied in full, or the writ has been dismissed. The amount you
send to the court may vary depending on the amount earned by the employee each
week.
NOTE: Federal law prohibits employers from discharging any employee because the
employee's earnings have been garnished for any one indebtedness. 15 USC § 1674.
