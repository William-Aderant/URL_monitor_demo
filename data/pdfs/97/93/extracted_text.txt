HOW TO SUBPOENA A WITNESS
A subpoena (pronounced "suh PEEN uh") is a court order that requires a person to appear and
testify in court (or at a deposition).1 If you believe a witness may not come to court when you ask,
you should have a subpoena issued by the court. If you do not subpoena a witness and the witness
does not appear at the hearing, you may be required to present your side of the case without that
witness.
Types of Subpoenas
There are three types of subpoenas. The first two can be used to order a witness to appear in court.
The third is used to order a witness to appear at a deposition. See pages 4 - 6 for copies of all three.
1. The Subpoena to Appear (CIV-111) is used to order a witness to appear in court to testify. It
may not be used to order a witness to bring documents or anything else to court. If you want
a Subpoena to Appear, do the following:
a. Go to the clerk’s office and get the subpoena form.
b. Fill in the blanks on the form. See sample on page 4.
c. Make sure the clerk has signed and sealed the subpoena (which usually will have
been done before giving the subpoena form to you).
d. Have the subpoena served on the witness as explained in the "Service of Subpoenas"
section on the next page.
2. The Subpoena to Appear and Produce (CIV-110) orders the witness to bring along certain
documents or other tangible things when the witness appears in court to testify in a case. If
you want this type of subpoena, do the following:
a. Go to the clerk’s office and get the subpoena form.
b. Fill in the blanks on the form. See sample on page 5.
c. Have the clerk sign and seal the subpoena.
d. Have the subpoena served on the witness as explained in the "Service of Subpoenas"
section on the next page.
3. The Subpoena for Taking Deposition (CIV-115) is used to order a person to testify at a
deposition. A "deposition" is a proceeding at which the sworn testimony of a witness is
taken outside of court.2 This subpoena may also order the person being deposed (questioned
at the deposition) to bring documents or other evidence to the deposition. To get one of
these subpoenas, do the following:
a. Serve a "notice of deposition" on every other party in the case. See Civil Rules
30(b) and 31(a) for what the notice must contain.
1 The court rule on subpoenas in civil cases is Civil Rule 45.
2 See Civil Rules 26 – 37 about depositions and other methods of obtaining evidence.

b. Show the court clerk proof that the "notice of deposition" has been given, and ask
the clerk for a CIV-115 subpoena form. (Note: Do not file the proof with the court
just show it to the clerk.3)
c. Fill in the blanks on the form. See sample on page 6.
d. Have the clerk sign and seal the subpoena.
e. Have the subpoena served on the witness as explained in the "Service of Subpoenas"
section below.
Witness Fees
You must pay a witness fee to each witness you subpoena. Witness fees are $12.50 if it will not
take more than 3 hours of the witness’ time to attend the trial or hearing (including travel time).
The witness fee is $25.00 if it will take more than 3 hours of a witness’ time to attend the trial or
hearing (including travel time). In addition, witnesses who travel more than 30 miles from their
residence must also be paid round trip mileage at the rate allowed for state employees.4
Witnesses attending from a point so far away that they cannot return to their residence day-to-
day also receive a per diem for meals and lodging.5 However, the per diem fees do not need to
be paid to the witness when the subpoena is served.
A check made payable to the witness for the correct fee must be attached to the subpoena when it
is served on the witness.
Service of Subpoenas
A subpoena can be served by one of the following methods:
1. Certified Mail.
A subpoena can be served by registered or certified mail only if it is mailed by the court.
To have a subpoena served by certified mail, you will need to provide the following to
the court clerk:
a. the original and one copy of the subpoena
b. the witness fee check or postal money order
c. an envelope addressed to the witness with sufficient postage to cover the Postal
Service charge for certified mail (including first class postage, the certified mail
fee, the restricted delivery fee and the return receipt fee)
d. completed certified mail forms from the Postal Service
(1) Check the "restricted delivery" box to restrict delivery of the subpoena only to
the witness.
(2) Address the return delivery receipt (green card) so that it will be returned to
you (the party requesting the subpoena).

e. cash or check made payable to the clerk of court for the fee charged by the clerk’s
office to serve the subpoena (currently $5.00)6
The clerk will mail a copy of the subpoena to the witness and retain the original for the
court file. After the witness picks up the certified mail, the Post Office will return the
green card (return delivery receipt) to you. You should bring the green card receipt with
you when you come to court in case you need to prove that the witness was served with
the subpoena. If the witness does not pick up the certified mail, you must try personal
service, described below.
NOTE: You will need to contact the post office to determine the current postage required
for certified mail. You will also need to contact the clerk’s office to determine the
current fee charged by the court to serve the subpoena by certified mail.
2. Personal Service
A subpoena can be served on a witness by any person who is at least 18 years old and
who is not a party to the action. This includes licensed process servers and police
officers.
If you want to use a process server, you can get a list of them from the court clerk's
office. Or, contact the Permits and Licensing Unit of the Alaska State Troopers at (907)
269-0393 for a list of licensed process servers. Each process server sets his/her own fees
for this service. For more information about process servers, see the booklet CIV-106,
How to Serve A Summons. If you choose to have a police officer serve the subpoena, you
must contact your local police department for instructions and fee information.
The person who has served the subpoena on the witness must provide proof of the service
by making a written statement of the facts (such as the date and time of service, the
document handed to the witness, the name of the person serving the subpoena, etc.) and
signing it. The signature must be notarized. This "proof of service" requirement can be
satisfied by filling out the "RETURN" section in the bottom half of the subpoena form.
You should bring this written and notarized proof of service with you when you come to
your hearing or trial in case you need to prove that the witness was served with the
subpoena.
